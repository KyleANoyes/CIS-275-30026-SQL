For the entire term, your results should match the samples shown, though DO NOT force it by 
  using the sample data in your queries since your queries must work when new data is added or changed.  
For example, if the sample shows results only for CustID 100, do not use WHERE CustID = 100.
  
When you are finished, you should be able to run the file as a script to execute all answers
  sequentially (without errors!).' + CHAR(10)
PRINT 'Queries should be well-formatted. SQL is not case-sensitive, but it is good form to
  capitalize keywords and to capitalize table names as they appear in the database; you should
  also put each projected column on its own line and use indentation for neatness. Example:

   SELECT Name,
          CustomerID AS "Customer ID"  -- Always use double quotes for aliases
   FROM   CUSTOMER
   WHERE  CustomerID < 106;            -- All SQL stetments should end with a semicolon

Whatever format you choose for your queries, make sure that it is readable and consistent.

Place the name of the database on the top of each query. 
Format all queries with the column names in the sample.

There are several ways to solve many problems. 
  Unless specified to use a particular one, pick one that works for you.

Be sure to remove the double-dash comment indicator when you insert your code!';

What are the order numbers?
---------------------
Create a query that returns all order numbers that have an order amount
     between $1000 and $1700.
You will be using the Invoices table. 
The name of the database is AP. 
You need to use the following:
- WHERE 
- AND
- BETWEEN 
Display only the VendorID and InvoiceTotal columns.
Hint: correct results will look like this.

VendorID    InvoiceTotal
----------- ---------------------
107         1600.00
83          1575.00
34          1083.58

Write a SELECT statement that finds all vendors whose state name starts with N. 
You will be using the Vendors table. The name of the database is AP.
You need to use the following:
   - WHERE 
   - LIKE
   - Wildcard

Display Vendor''s Name and Vendor''s State.
This time, use CONVERT to make the name 20 characters wide and state 5 characters wide. 
Note that some characters of the name will be chopped off.
Use AS to rename the columns. Always use double quotes with AS to make your code portable.
Display results in ascending order by VendorName.
You should get 10 records.

Hint: Correct results will look like this:

Vendor Name          State

Excluding Vendors?
--------------------
Produce a list of distinct Vendors with the following specifications:
- Inlcude only vendors that end with ''Inc''
- Ignore all vendors who reside in Massachusettes or Florida
- Sort the result in alphabetical order by Vendor name
- Use LIKE operator
- Use DISTINCT keyword
You will be using Vendors table, which is within the AP database.
Display Vendor name, Vendor Default Account Number, Vendor ID, and Vendor State 
   with the vendor name no more than 30 characters wide and the others 18. 
Make sure all your columns are named as shown below.

--Returns
---------
It is very normal that some vendors return the items they have purchased. 
The management wants to know which vendors have returned items they purchased.
Make sure you consider the following:
-Use the vendors table from the Examples database
-Format Vendor ID 9 characters wide, Vendor Name 20 characters, and Returns 10 characters.
-Add a dollar sign to the dollar values. Use any of the methods mentioned in Lecture 2, Sample Code. 
-As always, since you do not know the results before you write your code, do not use 
   any of the values (98, American Express, $556.19) in your code.
-Correct results will have 1 row and will look like this:
